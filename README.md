Implementation of linear least square fit algorithm on arbitrarily chosen real numbers

Linear least square fit is one of the most commonly applied form of Linear regression. 
It provides a solution to the problem of finding the best fitting straight line that passes through a set of points. 
Itâ€™s a mathematical procedure for finding the best-fitting curve to a given set of points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the offsets of the points from the curve. The sum of the squares of the offsets is used instead of the offset absolute values because this allows the residuals to be treated as a continuous differentiable quantity. 
Outlying points can have a disproportionate effect on the fit.
